## Overview

I was recently going through the types of driving tests that are performed in Europe out of idle curiosity at how they may differ from those in North Carolina and Florida, and ran into the Evasive Maneuver Test, also known by the way better name, the Moose Test. The moose test involves having drivers respond to a sudden animal crossing (often deer, elk, or moose). Drivers are advised to respond differently depending on the animal; deer often stop and stare, while moose have some business to attend to and keep sauntering on. For the moose, drivers should brake hard and swerve behind it, while for deer, one should brake hard, hold their horn, and aim around it. This test is common in northern European countries, Canada, and Alaska, as apparently moose collisions are particularly dangerous due to their weight and height.  

This got me interested in how common deer-related collisions are in North Carolina, or the US in general. Deer related accidents are quite prevalent across the US, causing an estimated 29,000 human injuries every year (Conover et al., 1995). More interestingly, there is a large spike in the number of deer related accidents during autumn. This autumn spike has been documented in general for northern regions with white-tailed deer (Allen and McCullough, 1976). There are two prominent explanations provided for the deer-related accident spike, both built around an increase in deer activity; hunting season and rutting season.

Hunting season starts at different times depending on the year, county, weapon, and mammal, but is approximately October through December. Hunting season has raised the anxiety of the deer leading them to move around more and at different times (Root et al., 1988). While there is evidence for the impact of hunting season on deer related collisions, the most influential factor appears to be rutting season in which the deer are more active searching for and chasing potential mates (Allen & McCullough, 1976). For the interested reader many of the papers on the subject are publicly available and go into detail about how various contextual variables, such as the habitat of an area (Bashore, Tzilkowski, & Bellis, 1985), traffic volume, and time of day can further influence deer-related accidents.  

While reading about all of this I ran into a fun little dataset recording deer and non-deer related accidents in North Carolina. I decided to play around with some different forecasting methods with it for the next year.

## Data Description

The data were compiled by the NC Department of Transportation for the years 2003-2007 (n<sub>obs</sub> = 60) by marking all accident reports by whether or not they contained the word "deer". The data display clear yearly cyclic patterns and seasonal patterns for the autumn months with a possible small trend (see figure below). October, November, and December all show a consistent large spike in deer related accidents. The signal-to-noise ratio is shockingly small, particularly when compared to the non-deer related accidents. Looking at non-deer related accidents we can see that the seasonal spike for deer related accidents is not due to a general increase in accidents during the late fall/winter, eliminating weather related explanations for the spike.

Next I decomposed the time series into seasonal, trend, and remained components. Since the data display few irregularities and the seasonal components are largely consistent, an additive classical decomposition was used. There is a slight upward trend and the proportion of random noise to the signal is low. The "random" competent displays some heteroskedasticity which may be problematic for modeling. The log is taken of the data and it is broken down into components again as seen in the right figure. The random component now appears acceptable. There was no missing data or apparent outliers in the dataset, and so we move forward to some models.

## Simple Regression

The first model I ran was a regression with month and time included as covariates. This model did not account for serial dependence, so it is unsuitable for statistical inferences due to incorrect standard errors and we would expect it to be less efficient at forecasting as there is information that isn't being used (the autocorrelation). Looking at the residuals of this model over time we clearly see that we do not have a white noise process and that this model is not appropriate. The ACF/PACF indicate that a SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,0,1)<sub>12</sub> may address these issues.

## SARIMA Regression

The second model had the months included as predictors along with a SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,0,1)<sub>12</sub> structure. The model appears to fit much better, with residuals looking like a white noise process and the ACF/PACF looking acceptable for the most part, though we do have one spike at PACF lag 12.

## Multiplicative SARIMA

In order to account for the dependence among residuals ARIMA models were fit according to the Box-Jenkins methodology using PROC ARIMA in SAS 9.3 and in R. All models were estimated using maximum likelihood. The data were first log transformed in order to account for heteroskedasticity and then seasonally differenced (12 months) to account for yearly dependence. The extended sample autocorrelation function (ESACF), the smallest canonical correlation (SCAN), and the minimum information criterion (MINIC) were computed to provide a tentative estimate of the orders of a ARMA(p+d,q) process. Differences in the BIC were minimal leaving two SCAN suggestions (0,1; 3,0) and three ESACF suggestions (0,1; 1,1; 3,2). The adaptive Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was run (lags 5-8) to assess the validity of the p+d=0 solutions; all solutions failed to reject the null hypothesis indicating further differencing was necessary. The series was differenced again resulting in a mean close to zero (-.001) and a series which appeared stationary; the ADF was rerun on the 1-12 differenced series. The Tau were all quite large for the zero mean version at lags 5-8, indicating no further differencing was needed. The first order and seasonal differencing left a total of 47 observations for model fitting, a low but acceptable number.

The SCAN, ESACF, and BIC were recalculated at a number of ARMA(p+d,q) values which suggested three candidate models; SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>, SARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>, and SARIMA(5,1,1)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>. These models were compared for AIC, their pattern of residuals, and their ACF/PACF/IACF values and estimated using maximum likelihood; the simplest and best fitting model was the SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub> with no significant ACF/PACF/IACF values and a lower AIC value. The plot below displays the forecast for the multiplicative SARIMA model. On the left the first 13 observations are left as scatterpoints as when the series was differenced this data could not be incorporated in the analysis.


## Model Comparison

The three models were compared using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Interestingly enough, as seen in the table the worst performing model was the multiplicative SARIMA even though all of its residuals looked good, unlike the other simpler models. This is likely because of the small sample size, making the differencing in the SARIMA model particularly costly, and the high signal-to-noise ratio allowing simple models to perform quite well. The SARIMA regression outperformed the simple resgression in terms of RMSE and MAPE, but the simple regression performed the best for MASE.  

| Model | RMSE | MAPE | MASE |
| ---- | ---- |  ---- |  ---- |
| Simple Regression | .071 | .795 | **.123** |
| SARIMA Regression | **.059** | **.702** | .507 |
| Multiplicative SARIMA | .092 | .995 | .727 |

THe prediction plots use bootstrapped 95% prediction intervals. We see that all three models had close predictions, with the smallest prediction band raound the SARIMA regression forecast. The model I would choose to use in this situation would be the SARIMA regression given its good performance and parsimony compared to the multiplicative SARIMA model.

## Concluding Remarks

The high signal-to-noise ratio in the data made the patterns easily interpretable and a fairly narrow prediction interval for the forecasts. It would be interesting to see how spatial location plays a role as well, as we might expect that more rural and open areas would display more marked spikes during rutting season compared to more disturbed environments (city).
