## Overview

I have recently run into an interesting time series dataset about monthly deer and non-deer related accidents in North Carolina in which a striking seasonal spike emerges during October, November, and December. The data were compiled by the NC Department of Transportation for the years 2003-2007 by marking all accident reports by whether or not they contained the word "deer". Looking at non-deer related accidents we can see that the seasonal spike for deer related accidents is not due to a general increase in accidents during the late fall/winter, eliminating weather related explanations for the spike. Deer related accidents are actually quite prevalent across the United States causing an estimated 29,000 human injuries every year (Conover et al., 1995). This autumn spike has been documented in general for northern regions with white-tailed deer (Allen and McCullough, 1976). There are two prominent explanations for the deer-related accident spike, both built around an increase in deer activity; hunting season and rutting season.

Hunting season starts at different times depending on the year, county, weapon, and mammal, but is approximately October through December. Hunting season has raises the anxiety of the deer leading them to move around more and at different times (Root et al., 1988). While there is evidence for the impact of hunting season on deer related collisions, the most influential factor appears to be rutting season in which the deer are more active searching for and chasing potential mates (Allen & McCullough, 1976). For the interested reader many of the papers on the subject are publicly available and go into detail about how various contextual variables, such as the habitat of an area (Bashore, Tzilkowski, & Bellis, 1985), traffic volume, and time of day can further influence deer-related accidents.  

After familiarizing myself with the data and context I decided to try forecasting the next 12 months in the series using a few different models. I can imagine the utility in predicting deer-related collisions for both insurance purposes and safety considerations by the wildlife commission in warning drivers during the peak risk season or choosing the timing of hunting season.

## Simple Regression

The first model is a naive regression in which the time-related dependence was ignored. The model included dummy coded variables for each month as well as a linear term for time. Looking at the residuals of this model over time we clearly see that we do not have a white noise process and that this model is not appropriate. This prediction for this model displayed a small prediction interval and a convincing looking forcast similar to the previous years. This forecast however should not be trusted, as the formulation of our prediction intervals was falsely based on the assumption of IID observations. Violating this assumption makes these intervals not credible, and indicates we need to address these non-random errors.

## Multiplicative SARIMA

In order to account for the dependence among residuals ARIMA models were fit according to the Box-Jenkins methodology using PROC ARIMA. All models were estimated using maximum likelihood. The data were first log transformed in order to account for heteroskedasticity and then seasonally differenced (12 months) to account for yearly dependence. The extended sample autocorrelation function (ESACF), the smallest canonical correlation (SCAN), and the minimum information criterion (MINIC) were computed to provide a tentative estimate of the orders of a ARMA(p+d,q) process. Differences in the BIC were minimal leaving two SCAN suggestions (0,1; 3,0) and three ESACF suggestions (0,1; 1,1; 3,2). The adaptive Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was run (lags 5-8) to assess the validity of the p+d=0 solutions; all solutions failed to reject the null hypothesis indicating further differencing was necessary. The series was differenced again resulting in a mean close to zero (-.001) and a series which appeared stationary; the ADF was rerun on the 1-12 differenced series. The Tau were all quite large for the zero mean version at lags 5-8, indicating no further differencing was needed.

The SCAN, ESACF, and BIC were recalculated at a number of ARMA(p+d,q) values which suggested three candidate models; SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>, SARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>, and SARIMA(5,1,1)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub>. These models were compared for AIC, their pattern of residuals, and their ACF/PACF/IACF values and estimated using maximum likelihood; the simplest and best fitting model was the SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)<sub>12</sub> with no significant ACF/PACF/IACF values and a lower AIC value. The plot below displays the forecast for the multiplicative SARIMA model. On the left the first 13 observations are left as scatterpoints as when the series was differenced this data could not be incorporated in the analysis.

this may be due to the many degrees of freedom lost due to the eliminated data and number of parameters fit in the SARIMA model.  It is likely it would outperform the simpler model if more data were incorporated into it.
