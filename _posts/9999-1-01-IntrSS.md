## Introduction to Bayesian State Space Models

[Describe weaknesses of ARIMA approach]

[Transition to how ARIMA is a special case of State Space Models, and that they can deal with many of these problems.]

Requirements
- Stationarity
- Knowledge of state dynamics and measurement models

Pros of State Space Modeling
- Exponential smoothing and ARIMA are special cases of it
- Deals well with missing data
- Allows for time-varying parameters
- Allows for irregularly-spaced data
- Can specify and estimate latent quantities
- Allows multiple sources to be combined to estimate one latent quantity

Cons
- Requires a-priori knowledge of the state dynamics and measurement models
- Additional complexity

[Provide a few examples of where and when state space models are commonly used]

## The Basics

[Explain basic theory]

## Specific Uses

### Missing Data

[Describe how it deals with missing data]

[Brief example]

### Irregularly-Spaced Data

[Describe how it deals with irregularly-spaced data]

[Brief example]

### Time-Varying Parameters

[Describe how it deals with time varying parameters]

[Brief example]

### Multiple Sources

[Describe how it deals with multiple sources for estimating latent process]

[Brief example]

## Conclusion

[Many more applications, but they are definitely pretty amazing]
