[Describe the essence of functional programming]

Pure functions and immutable data. Reasons why these are important

[Explain article will use pseudocode. Example of imperitive program, non-pure functional (side effects), and pure functional]

[There are many of properties of functional programming, we will go through them seperately]

## Characteristics

These are things that functional programming has. The distinction may not be perfect, but I think it helps seperate the ways in which functional programming is used vs. the mechanisms through which it works.

### First Class Functions

[Description]

[Psuedocode]

### Closure/Scoping


## Methods

These are ways that functional programming is used.

### Anonymous functions

### Currying/Partial applications

### Map/Reduce

### Functional Composition

### Tacit/Point Free

[Description, benefits, criticisms]
