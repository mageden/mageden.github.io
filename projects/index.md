Just a sample of another page that you could include for some purpose in the primary navigation.

- [List of Jekyll-powered websites](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites)
- [Octopress, a Jekyll based blog framework](https://github.com/octopress/)
- [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Jekyll source on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
- [Available plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#available_plugins)
