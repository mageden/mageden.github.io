## Project Overview

One key skill of a good analyst that has recently started gaining attention is their ability to engage in anticipatory thinking. Anticipatory thinking is our ability to anticipate the many possible outcomes of an event, or the many paths that may connect to a desired outcome. This may seem similar to prediction on the surface, however a key difference is that the success of anticipatory thinking is imagining the many possible futures that can take place, while the success of a prediction is merely stating the most probable one. An example of when these would differ is the management of a nuclear facility; one might say that it is unlikely to fail, and this would be a successful prediction, but to put together a contingency plan on the low probability case that it may fail would be successful anticipatory thinking. There are a number of analytical techniques used to help analysts engage in anticipatory thinking, such as alternative futures analysis or a red team analysis, however there has been little to no validation of these techniques, or even the construct of anticipatory thinking itself.

I am currently part of a team working on the modeling of anticipatory thinking, identifying its measurement, and developing a system able to assist analysts in its use. This project is done under the Laboratory for Analytical Sciences; Securing Critical Infrastructure group. We are currently developing a model for how anticipatory thinking occurs, and testing it using mechanical turk. A series of related constructs are being used as a measure of convergent validity for our proposed measurement, and a series of unrelated constructs are being used to measure discriminant validity. Structural Equation Modeling will then be used to test our proposed model of the construct, and the efficacy of our initial attempt at measuring it.
