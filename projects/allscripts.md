title: Novel Implementation of Attentional Boost Effect in PHR Design
---

## Project Overview

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that approximately 13 million people are injured annually from some form of medication error, such as forgetting a medication, administering an improper dosage, or taking a medication that has deleterious effects in conjunction with another medication currently being used. The rise in usage of personal health records (PHR) and electronic health records (EHR) will potentially decrease some of these errors from happening as doctors and patients are more informed. However, due to the complexity of implementing EHRs across the many health sectors and the technical challenges associated with the communication of EHRs and PHRs in a form that can benefit medical practitioners, these remains a need for patients to keep track of their health information.

This study, done in collaboration with Robert Sall and the Allscripts PHR usability team, aimed to improve recall of technical details in relation to a patient's pharmaceutical information through the use of the Attentional Boost Effect (ABE).    

### Attentional Boost Effect

The Attentional Boost Effect (ABE) is the surprising phenomenon in which encoding of environmental information is improved through unrelated event changes. The original demonstration of this phenomenon had participants recall information in a scene while monitoring the color of a square. They were told to report whenever the square changed color, and were later tested on their recall of the scenes. Scenes that were paired with a color change had improved recall. This effect has primarily been studied with a theoretical focus using basic attentional stimuli. This study was the first attempt to use this basic research and apply it in a real world setting.

## Method

All participants were undergraduate students in a Psychology class at a large landgrant university, and received research credit towards their course as compensation. A total of 43 participants completed the experiment. The experimental task involved participants being shown a novel drug on a wireframe of a PHR along with one piece of information about it; either directions on its use, dosage, side effects, or interactions. Half of the trials had an additional red circle displayed simultaneously in order to create an ABE. At the end of each block participants were given a cued recall task on a piece of information from one of the prior trials (such as the dosage for a particular drug), with four multiple choices. Participants first completed a short series of practice blocks, and then ran through 8 blocks each consisting of 8 trials.

## Results

The attentional boost effect was not replicated in this study, with no significant difference between trials with and without the concurrently presented red circle. This does not appear to be due to random guessing, as all conditions had accuracy ratings significantly higher than if they were random (25%). After running through the experiment, we discussed the result with some other labs and found that we were not the only ones who had trouble replicating the effect. The lack of replication could also be due to the substantially noisier environment compared to the basic attentional paradigm, or the higher presentation rate of the attentionally boosted trials (50%) compared to lower proportions in the literature. An initial boost in response may have later disappeared as a 'cry wolf' effect occurred and the participants learned to ignore the additional stimuli.

Based on the findings of this study, we concluded that the attentional boost effect would likely have limited utility in the EHR/PHR domain.
